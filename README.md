# ally-learns-nim
I'm learning nim. And applying it to a graphing problem

Entrypoint is `demo.nim`. Compile with `nim c demo.nim`, will handle all the magic for you. I'm using clang on macOS x64 to compile; no guarantees it'll compile the same elsewhere.

You will require the nimble packages `pixie` and `argparse` to compile this program.
